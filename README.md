#Basics-of-Programming-with-JavaScript
This is a repository that I use to accommodate learning material about JavaScript and the various tools in it
by putting the repository I created on public I hope this repo can be used by many of my friends and all students who want to learn about JavaScript
The terms and conditions for use are clear:
- you just need to clone the repo or download it as a zip
- extract and code ready to be studied
The source I used for learning this time was WPU-UNPAS [Basics of Programming with JavaScript].
